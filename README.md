# Project-Workshop
Description: end-to-end Data Pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to efficiently collect, clean, manage, and process raw customer data. This project utilized Google Cloud Storage for data staging, Google Cloud Composer (Managed Airflow) for automated workflow orchestration, and Google BigQuery as the central data warehouse. Subsequently, an interactive dashboard was created on Looker Studio to deeply analyze customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and interest trends. This enabled the extraction of actionable insights crucial for business decision-making and optimizing marketing strategies.
